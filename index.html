            <p>My name is Noah Shuler and I'm a student at Rose-Hulman Insitute of Technology! I'm currently double majoring in Computer Science and Software Engineering, as well as exploring minors in Cybersecurity and Data Science.</p>
            <p>I'm very active in the Computer Science and Software Engineering department at Rose: I'm currently a grader for Computer Archetecture 1, I'm a mentor for the Freshman Mentorship Program, and I'm a member of the Competitive Programing Team.</p>
            <p>Outide of School, I have a number of hobbies. I've been practicing Okinawan Karate-do for 8 years and I'm currently a first degree black belt. I love to design, build, and play games - including video games and sudoku puzzles. I workout regularly, visiting the gym almost daily with my roomates.</p>
